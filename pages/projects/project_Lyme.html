            of the project will allow us to have a solid understanding of how vaccines work as
            well as vector-borne diseases such as Lyme.  Our project is built around two main 
            proteins: Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) and Outer Surface Protein A (OspA).  WSP
            will allow the construct to be passed through generations of ticks.  It does so by binding to the sex-cells of ticks, which will then pass the plasmid through offspring.  OspA binds to the gut of the tick and binds to a region called TROSPA in the organism.  This allows for the bacteria with our construct to establish itself into the subject  and therefore, allow us to study the infected organism.</p>

This project targets ticks and allows us to detect Lyme using WSP, OSPA, and also a flourescent protein called Green Flourescent Protein (GFP). We transferred this setup through DH5-Alpha E. coli and also Drosophila before implementing it into ticks.  This would allow us to test that the vaccine was passed through generations of the organism.  </p>
