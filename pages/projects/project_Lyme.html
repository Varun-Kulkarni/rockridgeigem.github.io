            Loudoun County and if the project succeeds, we can apply it to the rest of the world.
            Through the project, we are learning about vaccinations and successful completion
            of the project will allow us to have a solid understanding of how vaccines work as
            well as vector-borne diseases such as Lyme.  Our project is built around two main 
            proteins: Wolbachia Surface Protein (WSP) and Outer Surface Protein A (OspA).  WSP
            will allow the construct to be passed through generations of ticks.  It does so by binding to the sex-cells of ticks, which will then pass the plasmid through offspring.  OspA binds to the gut of the tick and binds to a region called TROSPA in the organism.  This allows for the bacteria with our construct to establish itself into the subject  and therefore, allow us to study the infected organism.</p>

            <p class = "standard-text-1">Lyme disease is carried by the Lyme bacteria, which is difficult to detect since Lyme is a versatile and adaptive bacteria with respect to the hosts it establishes itself in.  This project targets ticks and allows us to detect Lyme using WSP, OSPA, and also a flourescent protein called Green Flourescent Protein (GFP). We transferred this setup through DH5-Alpha E. coli and also Drosophila before implementing it into ticks.  This would allow us to test that the vaccine was passed through generations of the organism.  </p>
